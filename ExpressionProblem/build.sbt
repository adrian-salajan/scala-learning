name := "ExpressionProblem"

/*
The goal is to define a data type and operations on that data type in which one can
add new data types and operations without recompiling existing code, but while
retaining static type safety

Any implementation of the expression problem should satisfy the following
requirements:

 Extensibility in both dimensions. You should be able to add new types and operations that work on all the types.
 Strong static type-safety. Type casting and reflection are out of the question.
 No modification of the existing code and no duplication.
 Separate compilation
